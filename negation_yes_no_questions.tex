\textbf{ala as an adverb}

In English, you make a verb negative by adding "not" in front of the verb.
Toki Pona \textbf{puts its negative word, \textit{ala}, after the verb}. 

\index{lazy}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi lape \textbf{ala}. && I'm not sleeping. \\ 
mi musi \textbf{ala}. && I'm not having fun. / I'm bored. \\
mi wawa \textbf{ala}. && I'm not strong. / I'm weak. \\
mi wile \textbf{ala} tawa musi. && I don't want to dance. \\
tawa musi && dance (move entertainingly) \\
mi wile \textbf{ala} pali. && I'm lazy. \\
\end{supertabular}

\textbf{ala as an adjective}

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan \textbf{ala} li toki. && Nobody is talking. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{ala}!\textit{ijo}}
\index{\textit{ijo}!\textit{ala}}
There's nothing wrong with putting \textit{ala} after the verb (which is \textit{toki} in this sentence), and in fact that's the more common way of doing it. 
However, you do have the option of using \textit{ala} after nouns, and so I just wanted to point that out. 

However, if you do that, try to remember \textbf{not use \textit{ala} with \textit{ijo}}. 
If not behind a verb, \textit{ala} already essentially means nothing by default, and so using \textit{ijo} just doesn't fit in.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{ala} li ' jaki. && Nothing is dirty. \\
\end{supertabular}

However, despite the differences in meaning, \textit{ala} and \textit{ali} as adjectives are used the same way.

\index{travel}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan \textbf{ali} li wile tawa. && Everybody wants to travel. \\
ma \textbf{ali} li ' pona. && All nations are good. \\
jan utala \textbf{ali} li ' nasa. && All soldiers are stupid.
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{ali}!\textit{ijo}}
\index{\textit{ijo}!\textit{ali}}
Also like \textit{ala}, it's best \textbf{not to use \textit{ijo} and \textit{ali} together}. 
By the way, \textit{ali li pona} is one of the Toki Pona proverbs, if you didn't know that.

\subsection*{Yes/No Questions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To make yes/no questions, you say the \textbf{verb, then \textit{ala}, then repeat the verb}. 
An questions always ends in a question mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina \textbf{pona ala pona}? && Do you fix (something)? \\
sina \textbf{ken ala ken} lape? && Can you sleep? \\
ona li \textbf{lon ala lon} tomo? && Is he in the house? \\
ona li \textbf{tawa ala tawa} ma ike? && Did he go to the evil land? \\
sina \textbf{pana ala pana} e moku tawa jan lili? && Did you give food to the child? \\
pipi li \textbf{moku ala moku} e kili? && Are the bugs eating the fruit? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Toki Pona has no form of the verb 'to be'. Some Yes/No question are not possible with \textit{ala}. Example: 'Is she a parent?'

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li \textbf{mama ala mama}? && Does she mother (somebody)? Does she wet-nurse (somebody)?  \\
% mama ala.             && No, she does not. \\ % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Answering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you want to say "\textbf{yes}", you simply \textbf{repeat the verb} of the sentence. 
If you want to say "\textbf{no}", you \textbf{repeat the verb and add \textit{ala}} after it. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina \textbf{wile ala wile} moku? && Do you want to eat? \\ \textbf{wile} && Yes \\ \textbf{wile ala} && No \\
 && \\ % no-dictionary
sina \textbf{lukin ala lukin} e kiwen? && Do you see the rock? \\ \textbf{lukin} && Yes \\ \textbf{lukin ala} && No \\
 && \\ % no-dictionary
sina \textbf{sona ala sona} e toki mi? && Do you understand what I'm saying? \\ \textbf{sona} && Yes \\ \textbf{sona ala} && No \\
\end{supertabular}
