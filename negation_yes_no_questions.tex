\textbf{\textit{ala} as an adverb}

In English, you make a verb negative by adding 'not' in front of the verb.
Toki Pona puts its negative word, \textit{ala}, after the verb. 

\index{lazy}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi lape ala. && I'm not sleeping. \\ 
mi musi ala. && I'm not having fun. / I'm bored. \\
mi wawa ala. && I'm not strong. / I'm weak. \\
mi wile ala tawa musi. && I don't want to dance. \\
tawa musi && dance (move entertainingly) \\
mi wile ala pali. && I'm lazy. \\
\end{supertabular}

\textbf{\textit{ala} as an adjective}

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan ala li toki. && Nobody is talking. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{ala}!\textit{ijo}}
\index{\textit{ijo}!\textit{ala}}
There's nothing wrong with putting \textit{ala} after the verb (which is \textit{toki} in this sentence), and in fact that's the more common way of doing it. 
However, you do have the option of using \textit{ala} after nouns, and so I just wanted to point that out. 

However, if you do that, try to remember not use \textit{ala} with \textit{ijo}. 
If not behind a verb, \textit{ala} already essentially means nothing by default, and so using \textit{ijo} just doesn't fit in.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ala li ' jaki. && Nothing is dirty. \\
\end{supertabular}

However, despite the differences in meaning, \textit{ala} and \textit{ali} as adjectives are used the same way.

\index{travel}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan ali li wile tawa. && Everybody wants to travel. \\
ma ali li ' pona. && All nations are good. \\
jan utala ali li ' nasa. && All soldiers are stupid.
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{ali}!\textit{ijo}}
\index{\textit{ijo}!\textit{ali}}
Also like \textit{ala}, it's best not to use \textit{ijo} and \textit{ali} together. 
By the way, \textit{ali li pona} is one of the Toki Pona proverbs, if you didn't know that.

\subsection*{Yes/No Questions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To make yes/no questions, you say the verb, then the adverb \textit{ala}, then repeat the verb. 
An questions always ends in a question mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pona ala pona? && Do you fix (something)? \\
sina ken ala ken lape? && Can you sleep? \\
ona li lon ala lon tomo? && Is he in the house? \\
ona li tawa ala tawa ma ike? && Did he go to the evil land? \\
sina pana ala pana e moku tawa jan lili? && Did you give food to the child? \\
pipi li moku ala moku e kili? && Are the bugs eating the fruit? \\
\end{supertabular} 

We had already learned the difference between verb and predicate (see page~\pageref{'predicate'}). 
Since Toki Pona lacks the verb 'be', sentences without verb are possible. 
Then nouns serve as predicate nouns or adjectives as predicate adjectives. 
Yes/No questions with the adverb \textit{ala} are only possible with a verb. 
You cannot write the missing verb 'be', then \textit{ala} and then again write the missing verb 'be'.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
...' ala'? && false \\ % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular} 

Example:"Is she a mother?" can't be formulated that way. 
\textit{mama} must be a verb here. 
We will later learn how to formulate yes/no questions with predicate nouns and predicate adjectives.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li mama ala mama? && Does she mother (somebody)? Does she wet-nurse (somebody)?  \\
% mama ala.             && No, she does not. \\ % no-dictionary

\subsection*{Answering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you want to say 'yes', you simply repeat the verb of the sentence. 
If you want to say 'no', you repeat the verb and add the adverb \textit{ala}} after it. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina wile ala wile moku? && Do you want to eat? \\ wile && Yes \\ wile ala && No \\
 && \\ % no-dictionary
sina lukin ala lukin e kiwen? && Do you see the rock? \\ lukin && Yes \\ lukin ala && No \\
 && \\ % no-dictionary
sina sona ala sona e toki mi? && Do you understand what I'm saying? \\ sona && Yes \\ sona ala && No \\

You can use the tool \textit{Toki Pona Parser} (\cite{www:rowa:02}) for spelling and grammar check.
