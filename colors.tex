\subsection*{Color Combinations}
\subsubsection*{A Shade of Colour}
%
\index{color}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Toki Pona there are no words for the colors purple, green, grey, etc.
But you can create colors from several words.
One uses one of these nouns \textit{jelo}, \textit{laso}, \textit{loje}, \textit{pimeja} or \textit{walo}. 
Then use these adjectives \textit{jelo}, \textit{laso}, \textit{loje}, \textit{pimeja}, or \textit{walo}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
laso loje li ' pona, tawa mi. && Purple (reddish blue) is my favourite colour. \\
laso jelo li ' pona, tawa mi. && Green (yellowish blue) is my favourite colour. \\
loje jelo li ' pona, tawa mi. && Orange (yellowish red) is my favourite colour. \\
loje walo li ' pona, tawa mi. && Pink (whitish red) is my favourite colour. \\
walo pimeja li ' pona, tawa mi. && Grey (dark white) is my favourite colour. \\
\end{supertabular} 

It is also possible to form colors from a noun and several adjectives. 
The goal of Toki Pona is however the simplicity.
Therefore, avoid complex word compositions.
Incidentally, the order of the colours doesn't matter.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
laso loje  li ' pona, tawa mi. && Purple is my favourite colour.  \\ % no-dictionary
loje laso  li ' pona, tawa mi. && Purple is my favourite colour.  \\
\end{supertabular}

Colors are usually used as adjectives because they describe nouns. 
The adjectives \textit{loje} and \textit{laso} describe the noun \textit{len} here.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
len loje laso mi li ' pona, tawa mi. && Dieses lila T-Shirt gef√§llt mir. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsubsection*{Samples in Several Shades of Colour}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Suppose that you have a shirt that have pattern with different colors (red and blue). 
However, you can't call it \textit{len loje laso}, because that means 'purple shirt'. 
The colours must be separated grammatically. 
Each color of the pattern is described with a noun and optional adjectives. 
To separate these color nouns with their adjectives we use the conjunction \textit{en}.
To separate the patterned item from its colours the separator serves \textit{pi}.
\textit{len}, \textit{loje} and \textit{laso} are nouns here. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
len ni pi loje en laso li ' pona, tawa mi. && I like this red and blue patterned t-shirt. \\
tomo pi jelo en loje pi meli Susan en mije jan Ken li ' nasa, tawa mi. &&  Susan and Ken's yellow and blue patterned house looks strange. \\
