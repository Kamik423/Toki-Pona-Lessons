\subsection*{Color combinations}
\subsubsection*{jelo, laso, loje, pimeja and walo as adjectives}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
You can \textbf{mix different colors}. 
Toki Pona is about simplicity, so keep it basic. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
laso loje && purple (reddish blue) \\
laso jelo && green (yellowish blue) \\
loje jelo && orange (yellowish red) \\
loje walo && pink (whitish red) \\
walo pimeja && grey (dark white) \\
\end{supertabular} 

Keep in mind that colors by themselves can't really follow any sort of logical pattern, so you're free to mix them around as you like. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
laso loje / loje laso && reddish blue (purple \\
laso jelo / jelo laso && yellowish blue (green) \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsubsection*{Using colors with \textit{pi}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Suppose that you have a shirt that have pattern with different colors (red and blue). 
However, you can't call it \textit{len loje laso}, because that means "purple shirt". 
So, we have to \textbf{use \textit{en} to separate the two colors}, and then we have to use \textbf{\textit{pi}} to show that the even though there are two different colors, they both modify the word "shirt".
\textit{loje} and \textit{laso} are nouns here. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
len \textbf{pi} loje \textbf{en} laso && shirt of red and blue \\
\end{supertabular}

% The word for today's miscellaneous section is \textbf{\textit{sitelen}}. 
sitelen as a \textbf{noun} means "\textbf{picture}" or "\textbf{image}". 
As a \textbf{verb}, it means to "\textbf{draw}" or to "\textbf{write}". 
\textit{sitelen} is most useful for the \textbf{compound nouns} that you can make with it. 
% \textit{sitelen tawa} ("motion picture") is used to mean either a "movie" or a "TV show". 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{sitelen tawa}  && movie, TV show \\
\textbf{sitelen tawa} "Fahrenheit 9/11" li pona, tawa mi. && I like the movie "Fahrenheit 9/11". \\
\textbf{sitelen tawa} "Bowling for Columbine" li pona kin. && The movie "Bowling for Columbine" is also good. \\
\textbf{sitelen ma} && map \\
o pana e \textbf{sitelen ma}, tawa mi. && Give me the map. \\
