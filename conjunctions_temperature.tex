%
\textit{anu} is used to make \textbf{questions} when there is a \textbf{choice} between two options. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Susan \textbf{anu} jan Lisa li moku e suwi?  && Susan or Lisa ate the cookies? \\
sina jo e kili \textbf{anu} telo nasa? && Do you have the fruit, \\ && or is it the wine that you have? \\
sina toki, tawa mi \textbf{anu} ona? && Are you talking to me, \\ && or are you talking to him? \\
ona \textbf{anu} jan ante li ' ike? && Is he bad, or is it the \\ && other person who's bad? \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{what!or what}
\index{what!\textit{anu}}
\index{\textit{anu}!or what}
Do you know how sometimes in English we say stuff like, "So are you coming \textbf{or what?}". 
% We can do the same thing in Toki Pona. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina ' pona \textbf{anu seme?} && Are you OK? \\
ona li ' mama \textbf{anu seme?} && Is she a parent? \\
sina kama \textbf{anu seme?} && Are you coming \textbf{or what}? \\ 
sina wile moku \textbf{anu seme?} && Do you want to eat \textbf{or what}? \\
sina wile e mani \textbf{anu seme?} && Do you want the money \textbf{or what}? \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textit{anu} can be used in declarative sentences also.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi lukin e mije \textbf{anu} meli. && I see a man or a women. \\ 
\end{supertabular}

\index{\textit{en}!conjunction}
\index{and}
\subsubsection*{\textit{en}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
This word simply means "\textbf{and}". 
It is used to \textbf{join two nouns in the subject} of a sentence together. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{en} sina li ' jan pona. && You and I are friends. \\
jan lili \textbf{en} jan suli li toki. && The child and the adult are talking. \\
kalama musi \textbf{en} meli li ' pona, tawa mi. && I like music and girls. \\
\end{supertabular}

\index{\textit{e}!multiple}
\textbf{Note that \textit{en} is not intended to connect two direct objects.} 
For that, use the multiple-\textit{e} technique (Page~\pageref{'multiple_e'}). 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi wile \textbf{e} moku \textbf{e} telo. && I want food and water. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Also note that \textbf{\textit{en} is not used to connect two whole sentences}, even though this is common in English. 
Instead, use the multiple-\textit{li} technique  (Page~\pageref{'multiple_li'}) or split the sentence into two sentences. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e kili ... && I'm eating fruit, ... \\ % no-dictionary
... \textbf{li} toki, kepeken toki pona.  && ... and I'm speaking in/using Toki Pona. \\ % no-dictionary
% / && \\ % no-dictionary
mi moku e kili.  && I'm eating fruit, ... \\ % no-dictionary
mi toki, kepeken toki pona. && ... and I'm speaking in/using Toki Pona. \\ % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular} 

\textbf{\textit{en} can also be used with \textit{pi} if two people own something together}. 
With \textit{en} you can avoid several \textit{pi} phrases.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
% tomo \textbf{pi} jan Keli \textbf{en} mije ona li suli. && The house of Keli and her boyfriend is big. \\
jan lili \textbf{pi} jan Ken \textbf{en} jan Lisa li ' suwi. && Ken and Lisa's baby is sweet. \\

% If you don't understand these examples below, it's because you have forgotten other concepts; \textit{taso} itself is common sense. 
% The only thing you need to remember is 
\textbf{Start a new sentence when you want to use \textit{taso}.} 
\textbf{Do not use a comma!} 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}

B: pona! mi tawa \textbf{kin}. && Cool! I went too. \\

\subsection*{Temperature and \textit{pilin}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
If you've forgotten, \textit{seli} means "hot" or "heat". 
We can use this word to talk about the weather. 
In this lesson, you also should have learned that \textit{lete} means "cold". 
Now the thing about these phrases is that they're only used to talk about the \textbf{temperature of the surroundings} in general. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{seli} li lon. && It's hot. \\
\textbf{lete} li lon. && It's cold. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{seli}!\textit{mute}}
\index{\textit{lete}!\textit{mute}}
\index{\textit{mute}!\textit{seli}}
\index{\textit{mute}!\textit{lete}}
You can also use \textit{lili} and \textit{mute} to be more specific. 
 
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{seli mute} li lon. && It's very hot. \\
\textbf{seli lili} li lon. && It's warm. \\
\textbf{lete mute} li lon. && It's very cold. \\
\textbf{lete lili} li lon. && It's cool. \\
\end{supertabular} 

If you're referring to a \textbf{certain object} that is cold, irregardless of the surrounding environment, you use \textbf{\textit{pilin}}.  
Suppose you grab an axe and you discover that the handle is cold. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ilo ni li ' lete \textbf{pilin}. && This axe feels cold. \\
\end{supertabular} \\

Also, just like with the \textit{lon} phrases, the \textit{pilin} phrases can use \textit{mute} and \textit{lili} to intensify the descriptions. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ni li ' lete \textbf{pilin} mute. && This is very cold. \\
ni li ' seli \textbf{pilin} lili. && This feels warm. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Other uses of \textit{pilin}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
You also use \textit{pilin} to describe how a person or an animal is \textbf{feeling}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{pilin} pona. && I feel good. / I feel happy. \\
mi \textbf{pilin} ike. && I feel bad. / I feel sad. \\
sina \textbf{pilin} seme? && How do you feel? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 

\index{think}
It can also mean "\textbf{to think}".

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{pilin} e ni: sina ike. && I think this: You're bad. \\ 
\end{supertabular} 

When you ask someone "What are you thinking about?" in Toki Pona, the "about" part is removed. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina \textbf{pilin} e seme? && What are you thinking? \\
\end{supertabular} 

However, when you \textbf{answer} to say what you're thinking about, the "about" part gets added back in. 
Use \textbf{\textit{pi}} if needed (see Page~\pageref{'mistakes_with_pi'}).

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{pilin} ijo. && I'm thinking (about) something. \\
mi \textbf{pilin pi} meli ni. && I'm thinking about that woman. \\
\end{supertabular}
