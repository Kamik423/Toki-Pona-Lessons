\subsubsection*{\textit{la} Preceded by a Single Word}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Let's look at a regular sentence and the same sentence with a \textit{la} phrase attached. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ilo li ' pakala. && The tool is broken. \\
\textbf{ken la} ilo li ' pakala. && \textbf{Maybe} the tool is broken. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textit{la} phrases come at the beginning of the sentence. 
The word or phrase that will affect the sentence comes first, then \textit{la}, and then finally comes a complete main sentence. 

A \textit{la} phrase can consist of a single word. This single word can only be a noun or pronoun.
A \textit{la} phrase can be a composite noun or Pronoun. That is, the noun or pronoun followed by one or more adjectives or \textit{pi} phrases.
Optionally, a conjunct (\textit{anu}, \textit{en}, \textit{taso}) can be used before the noun or pronoun.
A \textit{la} phrase can also be a complete sentence.

The noun \textit{ken} means "possibility".
\textit{ken la} therefore means "If there is a possibility" or better "Maybe".
 
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{ken la} jan Lisa li jo e ona. && \textbf{Maybe} Lisa has it. \\
\textbf{ken la} ona li lape. && \textbf{Maybe} he's alseep. \\
\textbf{ken la} mi ken tawa ma Elopa. && \textbf{Maybe} I can go to Europe. \\
\end{supertabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before we can actually learn how to use \textit{tenpo} with \textit{la}, we need to learn about \textit{tenpo} first. 
It acts just like any other noun. 

\index{day}
\index{night}
\index{present}
\index{today}
\index{tonight}
\index{future}
\index{soon}
\index{past}
\index{yesterday}
\index{last night}
\index{night!last}
\index{tomorrow}
\index{often}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo suno && day (sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja && night (dark time) \\
tenpo ni && the present (this time) \\
tenpo suno ni && today (this sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja ni && tonight (this dark time) \\
tenpo kama && the future (coming time) \\
tenpo kama lili && soon (little coming time) \\
tenpo pini && the past (past time) \\
tenpo suno pini && yesterday (past sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja pini && last night (past dark time) \\
tenpo suno kama && tomorrow (coming sun time) \\
tenpo mute && often (many times) \\
\end{supertabular} 

Now, you can stick these phrases before \textit{la} to tell \textbf{when something happened}. 

\index{drunk}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{tenpo} pini \textbf{la} mi ' weka. && In the past, I was away. \\
\textbf{tenpo} ni \textbf{la} mi lon. && At this time, I am here. \\
\textbf{tenpo} kama \textbf{la} mi lape. && In the future, I'll sleep. \\
\textbf{tenpo} pimeja pini \textbf{la} mi kama nasa. && Last night, I became drunk. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{age}
\index{old}
\index{how!old}
\index{year}
\index{birthday}
We also use a \textit{tenpo la} phrase to talk about age. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo pi mute seme la sina sike e suno? && How old are you? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Birthdays come once a year, and each time you have a birthday, you have gone around the sun one complete time. 
\textbf{To answer} and tell someone how old you are, just replace the \textit{pi mute seme} with your age.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{tenpo} tu tu \textbf{la} mi sike e suno. && Four times (\textit{la}) I circled the sun. \\
\end{supertabular} 

The prepositional object after the prepostion \textbf{lon} can be placed before \textbf{la} with the same meaning.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e telo \textbf{lon} tenpo ni. && I drink now. \\
tenpo ni \textbf{la} mi moku e telo.  && I drink now. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsubsection*{Expressing if/when with \textit{la}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mama mi li ' moli \textbf{la} mi pilin ike. && My parents die, I feel bad. \\
\end{supertabular} 

In casual English, we'd translate this as "If my parents were to die, I'd be sad." 
All \textit{la} phrases follow the same order as that example. 
If you like formulas and patterns, here's a good way to think about it. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
1 la 2. && If/when 1 happens, then 2 happens also. \\  % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular} 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi lape \textbf{la} ali li ' pona. && When I'm asleep, everything is good. \\
sina moku e telo nasa \textbf{la} sina nasa. && If you drink beer, you'll be silly. \\
sina ' moli \textbf{la} sina ken ala toki. && If you are dead, you can't speak. \\
mi pali mute \textbf{la} mi pilin ike. && When I work a lot, I feel bad. \\
sama pi ni en ona \textbf{la} mi wile jo e ni tu. &&  If this and that is the same, I want both.\\
tawa mi \textbf{la} mi pilin pona. && Am I in motion, I feel good. \\
tan ni \textbf{la} mi sona e nasin. && If this is the cause, we know the solution. \\
lon ona \textbf{la} mi ken lukin e ona. && If it has suchness, we can see it. \\
\end{supertabular} 

It is possible to use la two times in a sentence. But please not more than two. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ken \textbf{la} tenpo pimeja \textbf{la} ni li ' pona. && Maybe in the night it will be ok. \\  
\end{supertabular} 

\textit{la} is a word to separate phrases. Commas together with \textit{la} are neither necessary nor useful.

Now to use this concept in Toki Pona, \textbf{you have to split your idea up into two separate sentences}. 
Here's how you'd say "Lisa is better than Susan."

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Lisa li ' pona mute. ...  && Lisa is very good. ... \\ % no-dictionary
... jan Susan li ' pona lili. && ... Susan is a little good. \\ % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular} 

Make sense? 
You say that one thing is very much of something, while you use another object as the basis for comparison and say that it's only a little bit of something. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi ' suli mute. sina ' suli lili. && I'm bigger than you. \\
mi moku mute. sina moku lili. && I eat more than you. \\
\end{supertabular}
