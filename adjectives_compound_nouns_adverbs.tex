\subsection*{Adjectives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Toki Pona has a very minimal vocabulary. 
Many words do not exist in this language. 
Therfore, we often have to combine various words together.
Adjectives are used to describe nouns. 
The noun' jan' is described here with the adjective' pona'.
For example, there is no word that means 'friend'. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan pona && friend (good person) \\
\end{supertabular} 

As you can see the adjective (which was \textit{pona} in the above example) goes after the main noun. 
This will undoubtedly seem incredibly awkward to you if you only speak English. 
However, many languages do this. 

\index{victim}
\index{fork}
\index{spoon}
\index{knife}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan pakala && an injured person, victim, etc. \\
ilo moku && an eating utensil (fork/spoon/knife) \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{adjective!more than one}
You can add until three adjective to a noun. 
One adjective should not be used more than once.

\index{soldier}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan utala && soldier  \\
jan utala nasa && stupid soldier  \\
jan utala nasa mute && many stupid soldiers  \\
jan utala nasa ni && this stupid soldier  \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{adjective!more than one!\textit{ni}}
\index{adjective!more than one!\textit{mute}}
As you might have noticed, \textit{ni} and \textit{mute} as adjectives come at the end of the phrase. 
The reason for this is that the phrases build as you go along, so the adjectives must be put into an organized, logical order. 
Notice the differences in these two phrases.

\index{sidekick}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan utala nasa && stupid soldier  \\
jan nasa utala && fighting fool \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Possessives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You use pronouns (my, your, his, hers, its,) like any other adjective. 
If there are several adjectives the pronoun stands at the end.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tomo pona mi && my nice house \\
ma sina && your country \\
telo ona && his/her/its water \\
\end{supertabular} 

Other words are treated the same way.

len jan && somebody's clothes \\
seli suno && the sun's heat \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Adverbs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
