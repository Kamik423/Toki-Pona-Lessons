\subsection*{Adjectives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We had already got to know predicate adjectives as part of a predicate phrase. 
A predicate adjective describes the noun of the subject phrase.
In this example, the predicate adjective \textit{pona} in the predicate phrase describes the noun \textit{jan} in the subject phrase.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan li ' pona. &&  The person is good. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Generally speaking, one can say that adjectives describe nouns. 
As in other languages, adjectives can also be written directly with the noun. 
In Toki Pona the adjectives come after the noun to be described are written. 
This is exactly the opposite in English, but in other languages, such as Italian, this is normal.
Possible adjective slots are therefore located directly after nouns and, as described above, predicate adjectives in the predicate phrase. 
Adjectives are comparable with adverbs but in \textit{toki pona} some more complex.
The noun \textit{jan} is described here with the adjective \textit{pona}.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan pona && friend (good person) \\
\end{supertabular} 

A friend is nothing but a good person.
Since Toki Pona has a very small vocabulary, we often have to combine nouns with adjectives to say a certain term. 
Here are further examples. 

\index{victim}
\index{fork}
\index{spoon}
\index{knife}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan pakala && an injured person, victim, etc. \\
ilo moku && an eating utensil (fork/spoon/knife) \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{adjective!more than one}
You can add until three adjective to a noun. 
One adjective should not be used more than once.

\index{soldier}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan utala && soldier  \\
jan utala nasa && stupid soldier  \\
jan utala nasa mute && many stupid soldiers  \\
jan utala nasa ni && this stupid soldier  \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{adjective!more than one!\textit{ni}}
\index{adjective!more than one!\textit{mute}}
As you might have noticed, \textit{ni} and \textit{mute} as adjectives come at the end of the phrase. 
The reason for this is that the phrases build as you go along, so the adjectives must be put into an organized, logical order. 
Notice the differences in these two phrases.

\index{sidekick}
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan utala nasa && stupid soldier  \\
jan nasa utala && fighting fool \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Possessive Pronouns}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A possessive pronoun expresses a property or affiliation and is placed after the corresponding (composite) noun. 
This means that for a noun with adjectives, the possessive pronoun is placed after the adjectives. 
For a noun without adjectives, the possessive pronoun is located after the noun.
In these examples are \textit{mi}, \textit{sina} and \textit{ona} possessive pronouns. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tomo pona mi && my nice house \\
ma sina && your country \\
telo ona && his/her/its water \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{The Demonstrative Pronoun \textit{ni}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

The demonstrative pronoun is a kind of word with which the speaker refers to an  item of conversation. 
The demonstrative pronoun \textit{ni} can be used both like an adjective and like a noun.  
A slot for an adjective demonstrative pronoun is therefore possible after a noun. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan ni li pona. && This bloke is good. \\
jan li lukin e ijo ni. && The guy's looking at this thing. \\
\end{supertabular}

A noun demonstrative pronoun is used instead of the noun. 
Slots for noun demonstrative pronouns therefore correspond to the positions of noun slots in the sentence. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ni li pona... && This is good. \\
jan li lukin e ni. && The guy looks at that one. \\
\end{supertabular}
