We talked about how to ask questions that can be answered with a "yes" or "no". 
However, we didn't talk about questions that require more in-depth answers. 
Well, to ask questions like these in Toki Pona, we have to use the word \textit{seme}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{seme} li utala e sina? && What attacked you? \\
\textbf{seme} li moku e kili mi? && What is eating my fruit? \\
\textbf{seme} li lon poka mi? && What is beside me? \\
\textbf{seme} li lon tomo mi? && What is in my house? \\
\textbf{seme} li ' pona, tawa sina? && What do you like? \\ 
\end{supertabular}

Okay, this next part is probably going to seem rather confusing at first, and so I'm going to ease you into it by using things that you've already learned. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e pipi. && You're watching a bug. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Now we're going to turn that sentence into a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e \textbf{seme}? && What are you watching? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Both \textit{pipi} and \textit{seme} are treated as plain nouns, and the word order of the sentence does not change even when the sentence is a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pakala e \textbf{seme}? && What did you hurt? \\
sina lon \textbf{seme}? && Where are you? \\ 
ona li jo e \textbf{seme}? && What does he have? \\

\subsubsection*{Who(m)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Since you're asking about a person, you use \textbf{\textit{jan}}, then add \textbf{\textit{seme}} to make into a question word. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
\textbf{jan seme} li moku? && Who is eating? \\
\textbf{jan seme} li tawa, poka sina? && Who went with you? \\
sina lukin e \textbf{jan seme}? && Who\textbf{m} did you see? \\
sina toki, tawa \textbf{jan seme}? && Who\textbf{m} are you talking to? \\

\subsubsection*{Which}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ma \textbf{seme} li ' pona, tawa sina? && Which countries do you like? \\
sina kama, tan ma \textbf{seme}? && Which country do you come from? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 

The only reason that this concept might seem difficult is because you're tempted to move the word orders around, because many languages (including English) do it. 
\textbf{One neat little trick you can do to check a translation is to think of the question as a plain statement, and then replace the word \textit{seme} with \textit{ni}.}

\subsubsection*{Why}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textit{seme} is also used to make what equals the English word "why". 
Also, don't forget that \textbf{\textit{tan}} as a preposition means "because of".

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina kama, \textbf{tan seme}? && Why did you come? \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsubsection*{\textit{olin}}

This word is used to mean "\textbf{love}". 
However, it only refers to affectionate love, like \textbf{loving people}. 
For example, you might \textit{olin} your girlfriend or your parents, but you don't \textit{olin} baseball. 
You can't \textit{olin} things or objects. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{olin} e sina. && I love you. \\
\end{supertabular}
