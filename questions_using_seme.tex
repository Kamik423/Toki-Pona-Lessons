\subsection*{Questions, Questions}
%
We talked about how to ask questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no'. 
However, we didn't talk about questions that require more in-depth answers. 
Well, to ask questions like these in Toki Pona, we have to use the question pronoun (interrogative pronoun) \textit{seme}. 
Thus the word \textit{seme} replaces the sentence part on which it is asked. 
Depending on in what slot \textit{seme} is used, it can accept different types of words. 
At a question with \textit{seme} the sequence of word slots does not change. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Pardon?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
If with \textit{seme} a complete set is made, nothing was understood. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
seme? && Pardon? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{What -- Subject}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions who or what the subject is, in its place the word \textit{seme} is put in the sentence.
As you know this is the first position in the sentence. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
seme li utala e sina? && What attacked you? \\
seme li moku e kili mi? && What is eating my fruit? \\
seme li lon poka mi? && What is beside me? \\
seme li lon tomo mi? && What is in my house? \\
seme li ' pona, tawa sina? && What do you like? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{where!object}
\index{what!object}
\index{object!what}
\subsubsection*{What / Where -- direct Object}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions on direct object (recipient of action) \textit{seme} is used at the position of the direct object.
To simplify matters, we are taking a step-by-step approach.
Here's a statement:

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e pipi. && You're watching a bug. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Now we're going to turn that sentence into a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e seme? && What are you watching? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Both \textit{pipi} and \textit{seme} are treated as plain nouns, and the word order of the sentence does not change even when the sentence is a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pakala e seme? && What did you hurt? \\
ona li jo e seme? && What does he have? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{was!intransives Objekt}
\index{intransives Objekt!was}
\subsubsection*{What -- Intransive Object}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If \textit{seme} is used after an intransitive verb, one asks for an intransitive object. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina kepeken seme? && What are you using? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{was!Präpositionalobjekt}
\index{Präpositionalobjekt!was}
\subsubsection*{Was -- Präpositionalobjekt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
If \textit{seme} is set after a preposition, a question (what) is possible for the prepositional object.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pali e ni, kepeken seme? &&  What did you use to work on this? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \newpage
\index{why}
\index{\textit{tan}!\textit{seme}}
\index{\textit{seme}!\textit{tan}}
\subsubsection*{Why}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Preposition \textit{tan} and \textit{seme} are used to formulate' why'. 
Both words form a prepositional object here.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina kama, tan seme? && Why did you come? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{who}
\index{whom}
\index{\textit{seme}!\textit{jan}}
\index{\textit{jan}!\textit{seme}}
\subsubsection*{Who(m)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Since you're asking about a person, you use \textit{jan}, then add \textit{seme} as an adjective. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan seme li moku? && Who is eating? \\
jan seme li tawa, lon poka sina? && Who went with you? \\
sina lukin e jan seme? && Whom did you see? \\
sina toki, tawa jan seme? && Whom are you talking to? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{which}
\index{trick!question}
\index{question!trick}
\subsubsection*{Which}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
As at questions on one person also at questions on things \textit{seme} is used as adjective. 
It is inserted after the noun to be asked for. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ma seme li ' pona, tawa sina? && Which countries do you like? \\
sina kama, tan ma seme? && Which country do you come from? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 

The only reason that this concept might seem difficult is because you're tempted to move the word orders around, because many languages (including English) do it. 
One neat little trick you can do to check a translation is to think of the question as a plain statement, and then replace the word \textit{seme} with \textit{ni}.

You can't \textit{olin} things or objects.

Please write down your answers and check them afterwards. 

Try to translate these sentences. 
You can use the tool \textit{Toki Pona Parser} (\cite{www:rowa:02}) for spelling and grammar check. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
What do you want to do? &&   \\ % no-dictionary
Who loves you? &&   \\ % no-dictionary
Does it sweeten?  &&  \\ % no-dictionary
I'm going to bed. && \\  % no-dictionary
Are more people coming? &&  \\  % no-dictionary
Give me a lollipop! && \\   % no-dictionary
Who's there? &&   \\ % no-dictionary
Which bug hurt you?  &&  \\ % no-dictionary
He loves to eat. * &&  \\ % no-dictionary
 && \\ % no-dictionary
%%\end{supertabular}

%%And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English: \\
%%
%%\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Ken o, mi olin e sina.  && \\  % no-dictionary
ni li ' jan seme?  && \\  % no-dictionary
