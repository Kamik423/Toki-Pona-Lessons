\subsection*{The Question Pronoun \textit{seme}}
%
We talked about how to ask questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no'. 
However, we didn't talk about questions that require more in-depth answers. 
Well, to ask questions like these in Toki Pona, we have to use the question pronoun (interrogative pronoun) \textit{seme}. 
As you know, pronouns are proxies for different types of words.
The question pronoun \textit{seme} replaced the word or the part of a sentence which is inquired.
Depending on in what slot(s) \textit{seme} is used, it can represent different kinds of words or parts of sentences. 
Separators cannot be represented by a question pronoun \textit{seme}. 
At a question with \textit{seme} the sequence of word slots does not change. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Pardon?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
If with the question pronoun \textit{seme} a complete question is made, nothing was understood. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
seme? && Pardon? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Who/What -- Subject}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions who or what the subject is, in its place the question pronoun \textit{seme} is put in the sentence.
As you know this is the first position in the sentence. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
seme li utala e sina? && Who/What attacked you? \\
seme li moku e kili mi? && Who/What is eating my fruit? \\
seme li lon poka mi? && Who/What is beside me? \\
seme li lon tomo mi? && Who/What is in my house? \\
seme li ' pona, tawa sina? && Who/What do you like? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{where!object}
\index{what!object}
\index{object!what}
\subsubsection*{What / Where -- direct Object}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions on direct object (recipient of action) the question pronoun \textit{seme} is used at the position of the direct object.
To simplify matters, we are taking a step-by-step approach.
Here's a statement:

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e pipi. && You're watching a bug. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Now we're going to turn that sentence into a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina lukin e seme? && What are you watching? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Here the question pronoun \textit{seme} represents the noun \textit{pipi}. 
The word order of the sentence does not change even when the sentence is a question. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pakala e seme? && What did you hurt? \\
ona li jo e seme? && What does he have? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{was!indirect Objekt}
\index{indirect Objekt!was}
\subsubsection*{What -- Indirect Object}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If the question pronoun \textit{seme} is used after an intransitive verb, one asks for an indirect object. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina kepeken seme? && What are you using? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{was!Präpositionalobjekt}
\index{Präpositionalobjekt!was}
\subsubsection*{Was -- Prepositional Objekt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
If the question pronoun \textit{seme} is set after a preposition, a question (what) is possible for the prepositional object.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina pali e ni, kepeken seme? &&  What did you use to work on this? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%

\index{why}
\index{\textit{tan}!\textit{seme}}
\index{\textit{seme}!\textit{tan}}
\subsubsection*{Why}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The preposition \textit{tan} and the question pronoun \textit{seme} are used to formulate' why'. 
Both words form a prepositional object here.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina kama, tan seme? && Why did you come? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{who}
\index{whom}
\index{\textit{seme}!\textit{jan}}
\index{\textit{jan}!\textit{seme}}
\subsubsection*{Who(m)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions on one person the question pronoun \textit{seme} represents an adjective after the noun \textit{jan}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan seme li moku? && Who is eating? \\
jan seme li tawa, lon poka sina? && Who went with you? \\
sina lukin e jan seme? && Whom did you see? \\
sina toki, tawa jan seme? && Whom are you talking to? \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{which}
\index{trick!question}
\index{question!trick}
\subsubsection*{Which}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
At questions on things the question pronoun \textit{seme} represents adjective after the corresponding noun. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ma seme li ' pona, tawa sina? && Which countries do you like? \\
sina kama, tan ma seme? && Which country do you come from? \\ 
\end{supertabular} 

The only reason that this concept might seem difficult is because you're tempted to move the word orders around, because many languages (including English) do it. 
One neat little trick you can do to check a translation is to think of the question as a plain statement, and then replace the question pronoun \textit{seme} with the pronoun \textit{ni}.
