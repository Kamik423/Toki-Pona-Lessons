In Toki Pona relative location information is formed with special nouns. 
These special nouns are called 'spatial nouns'. 
In addition to the noun, adjectives, possessive pronouns or demonstrative pronouns are required for the relative location information. 

A spatial noun is preceded by either an intransitive verb or a preposition. 
This means that relative location information is either in an indirect object or a prepositional object and is therefore part of a predicate phrase.

Usually, the word \textit{lon} is used as an intransitive verb or preposition before a spatial noun. 
If no further verb is present, \textit{lon} cannot be a preposition. 
Then \textit{lon} can only be an intransitive verb.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
pipi li lon anpa mi.       && The bug is underneath me. \\
telo suli li lon monsi mi. && The sea is behind me.  \\
moku li lon insa mi.       && Food is inside me. \\
ma li lon noka mi.         && Land is under my feet. \\
ona li lon sewi mi.        && He is in my above, i.e. he is above me. \\
tomo li lon sinpin mi.     && The house is in front of me. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsubsection*{Spatial Nouns in a Prepositional Object}
%
\index{spatial noun!prepositional object}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

The following examples contain a verb. 
So \textit{lon} can only be a preposition. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku, lon poka sina.    && I'm eating beside [or with] you. \\
ona li pona e ilo, lon tomo ona. && He repairs the tools in his house. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Besides \textit{lon} other intransitive verbs and prepositions can also be used. 
In this sentence the second \textit{tawa} is a preposition and stands before the spatial noun \textit{noka}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi tawa e mi, tawa noka sina. && I bow before you. \\
\end{supertabular}
