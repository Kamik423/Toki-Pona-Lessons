% This word can be used for several different parts of speech, but I don't think that it's too difficult to understand.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan ni li ' \textbf{sama} mi. && That person is like me. \\

\textbf{\textit{tan} as a preposition} 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku, \textbf{tan} ni: mi wile moku. &&  I eat because I'm hungry. \\
% mi \textbf{tan} ma ike.   &&       I'm from a bad country. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textbf{\textit{tan} as a noun}

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi sona e \textbf{tan}. && I know the reason. / I know why. \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%
\index{\textit{tan}!nounn}
\index{nounn!\textit{tan}}

When used as a noun, tan means cause or reason. 
That can be helpful when you want to translate a sentence such as "I don't know why". 
However, you have to rephrase that sentence a little.

\subsection*{\textit{poka}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
poka is rather unique in that it can act both as a noun/adjective and also as a preposition. 
% Let's look at each of these uses separately.

\textbf{\textit{poka} as a noun/adjective} \\
This use is the same as you saw earlier in anpa, insa, monsi, and sewi. 
% Here are some examples.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
% ona li lon poka mi. && He is at my side. He is beside me. \\
jan \textbf{poka} && neighbor, someone who is beside you \\
\textbf{poka} telo && water side, the beach \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textbf{\textit{poka} as a preposition} \\

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku, \textbf{poka} jan pona mi. && I ate beside my friend. \\
\end{supertabular} 
%   
% So, you see, you can treat poka either as a noun/adjective or as a preposition. It's up to you, but whichever way you choose you can still express your thought. 
%
% \begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
% mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa. && I fought an enemy with a drunk guy. \\
% mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa. && I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy. \\
% \end{supertabular} 
%
% That's not so bad, now is it?

\index{\textit{monsi}!\textit{noun}}

\textbf{nouns} \\
Although you might be tempted to use these words as prepositions, but they are not. 
% \textbf{You have to use another preposition along with these words.} 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li \textbf{lon} sewi mi.    &&  He is in my above, i.e. he is above me. \\
pipi li \textbf{lon} anpa mi.   &&  The bug is underneath me. \\
moku li \textbf{lon} insa mi.   &&  Food is inside me. \\
mi moku \textbf{lon} poka sina. &&  I'm eating beside [or with] you. \\
\end{supertabular} 

So you see, these words as used here are nouns, and \textit{mi} is a possessive pronoun meaning "my". 
And since these words are merely nouns, you must still have a verb; in the above examples, \textit{lon} is acting as the verb. 
\textbf{Don't forget to include a verb!} 

Since these words aren't prepositions, they are free for other uses, just like any other noun/adjective/verb.

\textbf{\textit{monsi} as a body part} \\
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
monsi && back, butt \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{\textit{anpa}!verb}
\index{verb!\textit{anpa}}
\index{defeat}
\textbf{\textit{anpa} as a verb} \\
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{anpa} e jan utala. && I defeated the warrior. \\
\end{supertabular}

* \textit{lon} as a verb by itself means to exist, to be real, etc.
