Toki Pona's vowels are quite unlike English's. Whereas vowels in English are quite arbitrary and can be pronounced tons of different ways depending on the word, Toki Pona's vowels are all regular and never change pronunciation. 
If you're familiar with Italian, Spanish, Esperanto, or certain other languages, then your work is already cut out for you. The vowels are the same in Toki Pona as they are in these languages. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{2,5cm}|ll}

a   &&    f\textbf{a}ther \\ % no-dictionary

i   &&    p\textbf{ee}l \\ % no-dictionary

\subsection*{The More Advanced Stuff}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{All official Toki Pona words} 
\textbf{are never capitalized}. They are lowercase even at the beginning of the sentence! 
The only time that capital letters are used is when you are using unofficial words, like the names of people or places or religions.
