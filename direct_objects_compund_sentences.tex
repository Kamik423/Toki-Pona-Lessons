\subsection*{Direct objects using \textit{e}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
We saw how phrases such as \textit{mi moku} could have two potential meanings. 
'I'm eating' or 'I am food'. 
There is one way to specify that you want to say. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e kili. && I eat fruit. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Whatever is getting action done on itself is the 'direct object,' and in Toki Pona, we separate the verb and the direct object with \textit{e}}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li lukin e pipi. && He's watching the bug. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Also we discussed how \textit{sina pona}, like \textit{mi moku}, has two possible meanings. 'You are good' or 'You're fixing'. 
Normally, it would mean 'You are good' simply because no one really says 'I'm fixing' without actually telling what it is that they are trying to fix. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li pona e ilo. && She's fixing the machine. \\
mi pona e ijo. && I'm fixing something. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Only a (composite) verb can stand in front of the \textit{e}. 
More specifically, it is a transitive verb. 
A transitive verb does something to the direct object. 
Your can ask for direct object by' Who' or' What' (' What does she repair?'').
The \textit{e} is at the beginning of the direct object. 
After the \textit{e} there is always a noun or pronoun. 
The direct object is part of the predicate phrase.

\subsection*{Direct objects using \textit{e} with \textit{wile}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
To say that you want to do something definite, use \textit{wile} and \textit{e}.
\textit{wile} is here an auxiliary verb. 
An auxiliary verb is placed in front of the main verb and supplements it. 
An auxiliary verb belongs to the predicate phrase. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi wile lukin e ma. && I want to see the countryside. \\
mi wile pakala e sina. && I must destroy you. \\
ona li wile jo e ilo. && He would like to have a tool. \\
\end{supertabular} 

As you can see, \textit{e} doesn't come until after the infinitive in these two sentences, rather than before it.

\subsection*{Compound sentences}
%
There are two ways to make compound sentences in Toki Pona; one way involves using \textit{li}, and the other way involves using \textit{e}. 
Since you've now studied both of these words, we'll cover how to use both of them to make compound sentences. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{multiple \textit{li} technique}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
pipi li lukin li unpa. && The bug looks and has sex. \\
\end{supertabular} 

By putting \textit{li} before each verb, you can show how the subject, which is \textit{pipi} in this case, does more than one thing. 
Each \textit{li} starts a new predicate phrase. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku li pakala. && I eat and destroy. \\
\end{supertabular} 

While \textit{li} is still omitted before \textit{moku} because the subject of the sentence is \textit{mi}, we still use it before the second verb, \textit{pakala}. 
Without the \textit{li} there, the sentence would be chaotic and confusing. 
Compound sentences with \textit{sina} follow this same pattern. 
\textit{li} phrases are not nested. You can change the order. \\
ona li moku li pona. = ona li pona li moku. 

Each predicate phrase can of course contain direct objects. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e moku li lukin e ma. && I eat the food and look at the landscape. \\
\end{supertabular} 

The official Toki Pona book recommends to use only a predicate phrase for \textit{mi} or \textit{sina} as subject. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{'multiple_e'}
\subsubsection*{multiple \textit{e} technique}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The other type of compound sentence is used when there are several direct objects of the same verb.
In this case, all direct objects belong to a predicate phrase. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e kili e telo. && I eat/drink fruit and water. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textit{e} is used multiple times because \textit{kili} and \textit{telo} are both direct objects, and so \textit{e} must precede them both. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi wile lukin e ma e suno. && I want to see the land and the sun. \\
\end{supertabular} 
\textit{e} phrases are not nested. You can change the order. \\
mi moku e moku e telo. = mi moku e telo e moku. 

We can combine several \textit{li} and \textit{e}.
We have two predicate phrases with two direct objects each. 
However, it is better to use several short sentences. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e kili e telo li lukin e ma e jan. I eat fruits and water and see land and people. \\
\end{supertabular}
