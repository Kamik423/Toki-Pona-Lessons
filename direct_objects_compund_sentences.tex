\subsection*{Direct objects using \textit{e}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
We saw how phrases such as \textit{mi moku} could have two potential meanings. 
"I'm eating" or "I am food". 
There is one way to specify that you want to say. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku \textbf{e} kili. && I eat fruit. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Whatever is getting action done on itself is the "direct object," and in Toki Pona, \textbf{we separate the verb and the direct object with \textit{e}}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li lukin \textbf{e} pipi. && He's watching the bug. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Also we discussed how \textit{sina pona}, like \textit{mi moku}, has two possible meanings. "You are good" or "You're fixing". 
Normally, it would mean "You are good" simply because no one really says "I'm fixing" without actually telling what it is that they are trying to fix. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li pona \textbf{e} ilo. && She's fixing the machine. \\
mi pona \textbf{e} ijo. && I'm fixing something. \\
\end{supertabular}

If you need to say that you want to do something, follow this example.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi \textbf{wile} lukin \textbf{e} ma. && I want to see the countryside. \\
mi \textbf{wile} pakala \textbf{e} sina. && I must destroy you. \\
ona li \textbf{wile} jo \textbf{e} ilo. && He would like to have a tool. \\
\end{supertabular} 

As you can see, \textbf{\textit{e} doesn't come until after the infinitive} in these two sentences, rather than before it.

\subsection*{Compound sentences}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{multiple \textit{li} technique}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
There are \textbf{two ways} to make compound sentences in Toki Pona; one way involves using \textbf{\textit{li}}, and the other way involves using \textbf{\textit{e}}. 
Since you've now studied both of these words, we'll cover how to use both of them to make compound sentences. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
pipi \textbf{li} lukin \textbf{li} unpa. && The bug looks and has sex. \\
\end{supertabular} 

By putting \textit{li} before each verb, you can show how the subject, which is \textit{pipi} in this case, does more than one thing. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku \textbf{li} pakala. && I eat and destroy. \\
\end{supertabular} 

While \textit{li} is still omitted before \textit{moku} because the subject of the sentence is \textit{mi}, we still use it before the second verb, \textit{pakala}. 
Without the \textit{li} there, the sentence would be chaotic and confusing. 
Compound sentences with \textit{sina} follow this same pattern. 
\textit{li} phrases are not nested. You can change the order. \\
ona \textbf{li} moku \textbf{li} pona. = ona \textbf{li} pona \textbf{li} moku. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{'multiple_e'}
\subsubsection*{multiple \textit{e} technique}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The other type of compound sentence is used when there are several direct objects of the same verb.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku \textbf{e} kili \textbf{e} telo. && I eat/drink fruit and water. \\
\end{supertabular} 

\textit{e} is used multiple times because \textit{kili} and \textit{telo} are both direct objects, and so \textit{e} must precede them both. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi wile lukin \textbf{e} ma \textbf{e} suno. && I want to see the land and the sun. \\
\end{supertabular} 
\textit{e} phrases are not nested. You can change the order. \\
mi moku \textbf{e} moku \textbf{e} telo. = mi moku \textbf{e} telo \textbf{e} moku.
