\index{attention}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Sometimes you need to get a person's attention before you can talk to him.
When you want to address someone like that before saying the sentence, you just follow this same pattern.
\textit{jan} (name) \textit{o,} (sentence).
Note the comma behind the interjection word \textit{o}.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    jan Ken o, pipi li lon len sina.      &  & Ken, a bug is on your shirt. \\
    jan Keli o, sina ' pona lukin.        &  & Kelly, you are pretty.       \\
    jan Mawen o, sina wile ala wile moku? &  & Marvin, are you hungry?      \\
    jan Tepani o, sina ' ike, tawa mi.    &  & Steffany, I don't like you.  \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Commands}

\index{\textit{o}!interjection}
\index{\textit{o}!separator}
\index{subject!\textit{o}}
\index{exclamation mark}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

The command form (imperative) is introduced with \textit{o} and ends with an exclamation mark.
The interjection word \textit{o} is the subject here.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    o pali!                                       &  & Work!                            \\
    o awen!                                       &  & Wait!                            \\
    o ' pona!                                     &  & Be good!                         \\
    o lukin e ni!                                 &  & Watch this!                      \\
    o tawa, tawa ma tomo, lon poka jan pona sina! &  & Go to the city with your friend! \\
\end{supertabular}

We've learned how to address people and how to make commands; now let's put these two concepts together.
Suppose you want to address someone and tell them to do something.
Notice how one of the \textit{o}'s got dropped, as did the comma.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    jan San o, ...              &  & John, ...                \\ % no-dictionary
    ... o tawa tomo sina!       &  & ... go to your house!    \\ % no-dictionary
    jan San o tawa tomo sina!   &  & John, go to your house!  \\
                                &  &                          \\ % no-dictionary
    jan Ta o toki ala, tawa mi! &  & Todd, don't talk to me!  \\
    jan Sesi o moku e kili ni!  &  & Jessie, eat this fruit!. \\
\end{supertabular}

The separator \textit{o} replaces the separator \textit{li}.
After the personal pronouns \textit{mi} and \textit{sina} also the separator \textit{o} is used.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    sina o telo e sina! &  & Wash yourself! \\
\end{supertabular}

This structure can also be used to make sentences like 'Let's go'.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    mi mute o tawa!   &  & Let's go.       \\
    mi mute o ' musi! &  & Let's have fun. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Interjections}

\index{interjection}
\index{laughter}
\index{animal!noise}
\index{exclamation mark}
\index{\textit{a}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
An interjection sentence makes conveys excitement.
Interjections sentences often consist only of a noun or an interjection word, e. g. \textit{a}, and end with an exclamation mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    jan Lisa o, toki! &  & Hello Lisa!          \\
    pona!             &  & Yay! Good! Hoorah!   \\
    ike!              &  & Oh no! Uh! oh! Alas! \\
    pakala!           &  & F-ck! D-mn!          \\
    % mu! && Meow! Woof! Grrr! Moo! (sounds made by animals) \\
    a!                &  & Ooh, Ahh! Unh! Oh!   \\
    a a a!            &  & Hahaha! (laughter)   \\
\end{supertabular}

The interjection word \textit{a} adds emotion or stress.
It can be used at the end of a sentence.
Use the Interjektion-Word \textit{a} sparingly!

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    sina ' suli a! &  & You are so tall! \\
\end{supertabular}

The interjection words \textit{o} and \textit{a} only used when the person makes you feel really emotional.
For example, if you haven't seen a person for a long time or if you have sex and you still speak perfect Toki Pona.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    jan Epi o a! &  & Oh Abbie! \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Salutations}

\index{salutation}
\index{interjection!salutation}
\index{exclamation mark}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The second group of interjections are kind like salutations.
They usually consist of a noun, an optional adjective and an exclamation mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    toki!      &  & Hello!, Hi!                    \\
    suno pona! &  & Good sun! Good day!            \\
    lape pona! &  & Sleep well! Have a good night! \\
    moku pona! &  & Good food! Enjoy your meal!    \\
    mi tawa    &  & I'm going. Bye!                \\
    tawa pona! &  & (in reply) Go well! Good bye!  \\
    kama pona! &  & Come well! Welcome!            \\
    musi pona! &  & Good fun! Have fun!            \\
\end{supertabular}

They can also consist of a complete sentence with an exclamation mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
    jan Lisa o, toki! &  & Hello Lisa!     \\
    mi tawa           &  & I'm going. Bye! \\
