\subsection*{Addressing People}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Sometimes you need to get a person's attention before you can talk to him. 
When you want to address someone like that before saying the sentence, you just follow this same pattern. 
\textit{jan} (name) \textit{o,} (sentence). 
Note the comma behind the interjection word \textit{o}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Ken o, pipi li lon len sina. && Ken, a bug is on your shirt. \\
jan Keli o, sina ' pona lukin. && Kelly, you are pretty. \\
jan Mawen o, sina wile ala wile moku? && Marvin, are you hungry? \\
jan Tepani o, sina ' ike, tawa mi. && Steffany, I don't like you. \\
\end{supertabular} 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{command}
\index{command!\textit{o}}
\index{\textit{o}!command}
\subsection*{Commands}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The command form (imperative) is introduced with \textit{o} and ends with an exclamation mark.
The interjection word \textit{o} is the subject here.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
o pali! && Work! \\
o awen! && Wait! \\
o ' pona! && Be good! \\
o lukin e ni! && Watch this! \\
o tawa, tawa ma tomo, lon poka jan pona sina! && Go to the city with your friend! \\
\end{supertabular} 

We've learned how to address people and how to make commands; now let's put these two concepts together. 
Suppose you want to address someone and tell them to do something. 
Notice how one of the \textit{o}'s got dropped, as did the comma. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan San o, ...  && John, ... \\ % no-dictionary
 ... o tawa tomo sina! && ... go to your house! \\ % no-dictionary
jan San o tawa tomo sina!  && John, go to your house! \\
 && \\ % no-dictionary
jan Ta o toki ala, tawa mi! && Todd, don't talk to me! \\
jan Sesi o moku e kili ni! && Jessie, eat this fruit!. \\
\end{supertabular} 

The separator \textit{o} replaces the separator \textit{li}. After \textit{mi} and \textit{sina} also the separator \textit{o} is used. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina o telo e sina! && Wash yourself! \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{let's go}
This structure can also be used to make sentences like 'Let's go'.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi mute o tawa! && Let's go. \\
mi mute o ' musi! && Let's have fun. \\
\end{supertabular}

\subsection*{Interjections}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
An interjection sentence makes conveys excitement.
Interjections sentences often consist only of a noun or an interjection word (e. g.: \textit{a}) and end with an exclamation mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Lisa o, toki! && Hello Lisa! \\
pona! && Yay! Good! Hoorah! \\
ike! && Oh no! Uh! oh! Alas! \\
pakala! && F-ck! D-mn! \\
mu! && Meow! Woof! Grrr! Moo! (sounds made by animals) \\
a! && Ooh, Ahh! Unh! Oh! \\
a a a! && Hahaha! (laughter) \\
\end{supertabular} 

The interjection word \textit{a} adds emotion or stress. 
It can be used at the end of a sentence.
Use the Interjektion-Word \textit{a} sparingly!

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sina ' suli a! && You are so tall! \\
\end{supertabular} 

The interjection words \textit{o} and \textit{a} only used when the person makes you feel really emotional. 
For example, if you haven't seen a person for a long time or if you have sex with them and you still speak perfect Toki Pona. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Epi o a! && Oh Abbie! \\
\end{supertabular} 

\index{Good day}
\index{Sleep well}
\index{Enjoy your meal}
\index{Bye}
\index{Good bye}
\index{Welcome}
\index{Have fun}
\subsection*{Salutations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The second group of interjections are kind like salutations.
They usually consist of a noun, an optional adjective and an exclamation mark. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
toki! && Hello!, Hi! \\
suno pona! && Good sun! Good day! \\
lape pona! && Sleep well! Have a good night! \\
moku pona! && Good food! Enjoy your meal! \\
mi tawa && I'm going. Bye! \\
tawa pona! && (in reply) Go well! Good bye! \\
kama pona! && Come well! Welcome! \\
musi pona! && Good fun! Have fun! \\
\end{supertabular}  

They can also consist of a complete sentence with an exclamation mark.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Lisa o, toki! && Hello Lisa! \\
mi tawa && I'm going. Bye! \\
\end{supertabular}
